# Full-Stack Customer List Project

This project is a full-stack application designed as a coding challenge for the commerce team at New Relic. The application allows users to view and interact with a list of customers. It includes basic filtering and sorting functionalities to enhance the user experience.

## Overview

The project consists of two main parts:

- **Front End**: A React application that provides a user interface to display the customer list, along with search, filter, and sort features.
- **Back End**: A Flask application that serves as an API to manage customer data, handle queries, and return the necessary data to the front end.

## Features

- **Customer List**: Displays a list of customers with their first name, last name, and company name.
- **Search**: Allows users to search for customers by their first or last name.
- **Filter**: Provides a dropdown to filter customers by company name.
- **Sort**: Enables sorting of customers by first name, last name, or company name in both ascending and descending order.
